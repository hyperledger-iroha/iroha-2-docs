# Advanced Topics

This is the part of the tutorial where we say "you're not a newbie anymore"
and hit you hard with the features that make Iroha truly special.

Here we cover in some breadth the [Iroha special instructions](./isi.md),
[Web-assembly](./wasm.md), and how both are used in creating what's known
as a _smart contract_. We also explain the [triggers](./triggers.md) and
[queries](./queries.md) in detail.
