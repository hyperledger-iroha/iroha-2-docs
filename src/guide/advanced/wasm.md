# WASM

While we had initially assumed that all operations within Iroha will be
handled with instructions and conditionals, however, there are a few
problems with this approach.

- The ISI syntax is verbose and ugly.
- The ISI syntax is not familiar for most programmers.
- While ISI smart contracts are compact (usually a few bytes), they need to
  be hand-optimised.

In the long run, all of these problems are taken care of by using a
**domain-specific language**, which gets optimised and compiled into a
sequence of instructions that executes fast and takes very little space in
the blocks, but is also easy to understand. Something that looks like your
traditional `if` statements and `for` loops.

However, in the interim, we have decided to use another portable binary
standard called **Web assembly** or **WASM**. The main advantage of this
format is that you can use any language you like (as long as it links
statically against our helper library), and produce a 32-bit portable
executable. The compilers take care of the optimisation, and you don't have
to learn a new language (ahem… solidity… ahem), just to operate on the
blockchain.

You'd still need to use ISI from inside your WASM binary to do anything
on-chain, but you can do other things, and write e.g. Rust instead of
composing Generic `structs` inside a macro to get conditional logic.
Moreover, as long as you fit within the limits of WASM runtime, and the
provided libraries, you can do anything (and everything) you want.

The drawback is that this process is a tad more involved than just writing
the ISI using the client libraries.

## Simple Rust Smart Contract

WASM projects, just like any other binary in Rust need to be separate
crates. Don't worry, it doesn't have to be big.

To get started you might want to use

```bash
cargo new --lib
```

to create a new project. Yes, we need the `lib` type, more on that later.

The `Cargo.toml` of the project should look something like this:

```toml
[package]
name  = "smartcontract"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ['cdylib']

[dependencies]
iroha_wasm = { git = "https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/", branch = "iroha2" }
```

Note that the crate type is `cdylib`. Most Rust code is linked in a
non-portable architecture and OS-specific static manner, but WASM is a
portable format. Since C ABI is the _lingua franca_ of the programming
world and there is no other stable Rust ABI (yet), Iroha relies on the
C-linkage to generate WASM bindings. Thankfully, you don't need to worry
about foreign function interface (FFI)-related problems like `unsafe`,
`repr(C)`, padding, alignment etc., `iroha_wasm` takes care of all that for
you.

`iroha_wasm` is the crate that contains all of the bindings, macros and
trait implementations that you'd need to write the program, most notably
the `iroha_wasm` attribute macro. The crate also exposes our `data_model`
which contains all of the basic ISI and types. `parity-scale-codec` is (as
of today) the chosen serialisation format with a strong possibility of
getting replaced with a different (custom) serialisation format in the near
future, as it seems to dominate the binary size[^2].

Now that we have the preliminaries nailed down, we get to write some code
for our smart contract. In the `src/lib.rs` you should write the following:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern crate alloc;

use alloc::vec::Vec;

use iroha_wasm::data_model::prelude::*;

#[iroha_wasm::iroha_wasm]
fn smartcontract_entry_point(_account_id: AccountId) {
    let query = QueryBox::FindAllDomains(FindAllDomains {});
    let domains: Vec<Domain> = query.execute().try_into().unwrap();

    for domain in domains {
        let new_account_id = AccountId {
            name: Name::new("mad_hatter").unwrap(),
            domain_id: domain.id,
        };

        Instruction::Register(RegisterBox::new(NewAccount::new(new_account_id))).execute();
    }
}
```

`cargo run --release` will submit the instruction and run it for you (be
sure to have a peer up).

What this smart contract does is query all of the currently existing
domains, put the results into a `std::vec::Vec`, which in this case has to
be imported from `alloc`, as we use `no_std` (more on that later), which is
then used to add the user named `mad_hatter` to all of the existing
domains.

Building the same logic out of `Expression` and `If` and `Sequence` would
be significantly harder. Moreover, the actual low-level instructions that
would run are very likely not going to be as well-optimised as what the
compiler produces.

## Advanced Smart Contracts: Optimising for Size

WASM smart contracts can get big. So big, in fact, that we might not let
you store them in the blockchain. So how do you reduce the size? The most
important modifications are done in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.release]
strip = "debuginfo" # Remove debugging info from the binary
panic = "abort"     # Panics are transcribed to Traps when compiling for wasm anyways
lto = true          # Link-time-optimisation produces notable decrease in binary size
opt-level = "z"     # Optimise for size vs speed with "s"/"z"(removes vectorization)
codegen-units = 1   # Further reduces binary size but increases compilation time
```

Rust stores a lot of debug information (even when compiled in `release`
mode), which is (as the name suggests) used for debugging a panic in your
Rust application. As you would expect, this information increases the size
of the compiled WASM significantly. Normally, this would be a worthwhile
trade-off, but not in our case. Firstly, since the WASM is stored on-chain,
it will be permanently recorded in some block and take space on every full
node of an Iroha network (which by the way, stores a lot of its information
in RAM), so storage space for WASM is at a premium. Secondly, once the WASM
smart contract is stored on-chain, the debug information is no longer
accessible. Indeed, you shouldn't debug on a peer. Instead, you should
replicate the conditions that caused the panic locally and debug on your
personal machine.

Another step that we've already taken involves working under a `no_std`
environment. All of our size-related woes stem from Rust being
predominantly statically linked. As such, breaking the standard library
into more manageable crates, like using `alloc::vec` instead of `std::vec`
can help us reduce the size and compilation time[^3].

Next, you're advised to re-compile `libcore` and any other standard library
crate (e.g. `alloc`) to exclude the leftover panic-related code that comes
with prebuilt the `core` library[^4]:

```bash
cargo +nightly build -Z build-std -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Unfortunately, this is an unstable feature. In other words, the developers
of the Rust programming language can decide to change how this works, or
remove this option entirely.

Finally, you can use an automated tool to optimise the size of the WASM
using [`wasm-opt`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen), or use
[`twiggy`](https://rustwasm.github.io/twiggy/) to guide your manual
optimisation efforts. Using `wasm-opt` is highly advised because it will
often significantly reduce your binary size, e.g.:

```bash
wasm-opt -Os -o output.wasm input.wasm
```

At some point, unfortunately, the smallest size of your WASM blob is going
to be determined by the libraries that you need to use. Using all of the
above steps on the provided smart contract can reduce it down to a
manageable (for the blockchain) size.

    Size is an important metric. We shall cover size-optimisation
    strategies as we go.

    It should be noted, that excluding the standard library is necessary
    for compiling to the wasm32 target, and is thus mandatory.

[^4]: `wasm-opt` can also be used to remove the debug sections.
