# Conclusions

The current iteration of the Iroha 2 tutorial is a constant work in progress. We are updating the tutorial with each release to reflect the state of Iroha and the newly added features. While we do our best, to keep this tutorial up to date, it can go out of sync by a few days or maybe a week.

Additionally, this tutorial will have a few sections dedicated to
- permissions;
- multi signature accounts/transactions,
- custom permission validators
- permission groups.
- triggers
- WASM smartcontracts
- Iroha special instructions
and a few more advanced topics

Another major topic to be included will be peer management; covering adding and removing peers, maintaining a healthy network and troubleshooting the issues that you might have in your real-world application.
