# Launch Iroha

1. Install the prerequisites:

   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

2. [Install Iroha](./install.md).

3. Run `docker compose` and specify the network configuration file to bring up a network of 4 containerized peers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f configs/swarm/docker-compose.yml up
   ```

   Depending on your set-up, this might either
   [pull the image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/iroha2/tags) from DockerHub, or build the container locally. After this process
   completes, you'll receive the following output:

   <<< @/guide/get-started/launch-iroha.docker-compose-output.ansi

4. Proceed to the [CLI tutorial](./operate-iroha-via-cli.md) to check out Iroha's capabilities.

5. When you're done with the test network, just hit `Control + C` to stop the
   containers (`âŒƒ + C` on Mac).

## Docker Options

You might also be interested in other options for local compilation:

- To test Iroha code quickly, you can use `docker-compose-single.yml`,
  which starts a container with a single peer.
- For testing Iroha code in normal conditions, you can use
  `docker-compose-local.yml`, which starts 4 connected containers with
  peers.

::: info

Please note that there is ongoing work to make our configurations for
Docker even more customizable with the help of Swarm.

Now that you have Iroha up and running, proceed to the [CLI tutorial](/guide/get-started/operate-iroha-via-cli) to learn how to work with it.
