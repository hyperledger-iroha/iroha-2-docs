If you have previously worked with Iroha, start with our comparison of
[Iroha 1 and Iroha 2](/guide/iroha-2.md). That will help you understand the
differences between the two versions and upgrade to the newer one.

Before you dive into tutorials and deploy Iroha 2, we suggest you read through the [Security](/guide/security/index.md) section to learn about [core security principles](/guide/security/security-principles.md) and [operational security measures](/guide/security/operational-security.md) that are necessary to ensure the safety and validity of data and assets. This section also covers [cryptographic keys](/guide/security/public-key-cryptography.md), [how to generate them](/guide/security/generating-cryptographic-keys.md), and [how to store them securely](/guide/security/storing-cryptographic-keys.md).

Check the [tutorial](/guide/get-started/tutorials.md) where you
can follow one of the available language-specific guides in
[Bash](/guide/get-started/bash.md), [Rust](/guide/get-started/rust.md),
[Kotlin](/guide/get-started/kotlin-java.md), [Javascript](/guide/get-started/javascript.md), or
[Python](/guide/get-started/python.md). The guides introduce you to the basic concepts
and provide code snippets that you can run yourself.

In the Blockchain chapter you can find documentation for Iroha features,
such as [Iroha Special Instructions](/guide/blockchain/instructions.md),
[triggers](/guide/blockchain/triggers.md),
[queries](/guide/blockchain/queries.md).

The Configuration and Management section explains Iroha 2 configuration files in great detail and covers topics such as [genesis blocks and accounts](/guide/configure/genesis.md), [client configuration](/guide/configure/client-configuration.md), and [public and private modes](/guide/configure/modes.md).
