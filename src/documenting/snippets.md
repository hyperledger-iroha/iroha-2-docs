# Code snippets

Iroha development happens around three important branches:
[`dev`](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/iroha2-dev),
[`stable`](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/iroha2-stable), and
[`LTS`](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/iroha2-lts).

With that in mind, documenting all the API versions manually has
limitations: at some point, the content in one of the branches will be
different compared to the documentation. Moreover, code in the
documentation may contain typos sometimes, and being able to run it won't
be guaranteed without testing. This raises questions about showing the
differences between branches for the new developers semi-automatically.

Our solution is to use a custom syntax in the code comments to mark the
snippets with the [dst-parser](https://github.com/soramitsu/dst-parser). We
configure URLs in a custom JSON config file and automatically query the
related URLs both on local builds and CI.

In addition, we're also using a custom
[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin, so that
we can easily include the resulting snippets.

## Workflow

### Preparing the requirements

After you run `pnpm install`, a prebuilder script will run to ensure that
an output directory for the snippets (`src/snippets`) exists. It will also
download the snippets if those are not available.

Alternatively, you can run the prebuilder with the `pnpm run postinstall`
commands.

### Getting snippets

To download and convert the raw files, type: `pnpm run get_snippets`.

This will run a script that:

- downloads each snippet file in parallel
- parses them using a
  [dst-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dst-parser) and extracts
  individual snippets
- exports the parsed snippets into the individual code files in the
  `src/snippets` directory
- exports the JSON metadata file (`meta.json`) into the same directory

The filename is formatted like this: `version_lang_name.extension`.

This approach allows attaching all the snippets by their names from the
custom component of the project's documentation system. This component is
implemented using [Vue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js), which is
already used in the [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) documentation
generator and is called with a custom Markdown syntax described below in
this article.

### Defining the sources for the documentation

To collect the code, we're using a custom [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) script;
it reads a configuration list from a file named `snippet_sources.json` in
the documentation root, obtaining a list of items, each of which contains:

- `url`: the `URL` of a file to parse, it supports `http://`, `https://`,
  and relative file URLs, and it is mainly used for
  [GitHub](https://github.com/) raw files
- `lang`: a language to highlight using
  [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/)
- `version`: a branch or Iroha version (for example, `stable`, `dev`, or
  `lts`), which is used in file prefixes to distinguish between similar
  snippet names

Generally, we want two types of files to be used as documentation sources:

- raw sources from [GitHub](https://github.com/), because they are easy to
  parse and there's no additional markup
- source code files to use in this demo

Let's check the contents of the `snippet_sources.json` example:

```json
[
  {
    "version": "stable",
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/project/stable/examples/filename.rs",
    "lang": "rust"
  },
  {
    "version": "dev",
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/project/dev/examples/filename.rs",
    "lang": "rust"
  },
  {
    "version": "lts",
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/project/lts/examples/filename.rs",
    "lang": "rust"
  }
]
```

We could have many source definitions[^1] inside this list, but each
definition, represented as a dictionary, is required to have the properties
displayed above: `version`, `url`, `lang`. At a later date, automatic
language detection may be added.



## Code comment syntax

Currently, the [dst-parser](https://github.com/soramitsu/dst-parser)
supports two comment formats: C-like (`//`) and Pythonic (`#`). Multiline
comments (`/* … */` and `""" … """`) are not parsed. The supported
languages are Rust, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python.

A piece of code is considered a named fragment when it is located between
`// BEGIN FRAGMENT: <name>` and `// END FRAGMENT`, where `<>` signs are not
included. This syntax is case-sensitive. Names support alphanumeric
characters, underscores, minus signs, and white spaces.

Fragments can be included in one another. In that case, the lines matching
`// BEGIN FRAGMENT: <name>` and `// END FRAGMENT` are removed.

Elements between `// BEGIN ESCAPE` and `// END ESCAPE` are excluded
unconditionally from the tutorial.

While defining code documentation, you can use both underscores and white
spaces. It is preferable to use white spaces because they're used for
prefixing branch names.

The current version of the snippet collection script supports both normal
URLs and file paths[^2].

Considering the current design, specifically the layout and font
configuration, the optimal width for doc comments is 66 characters,
starting with a comment symbol(s). If there's common padding behind each
line, it is also removed. If the content is too long, it won't fit normally
and a scrollbar will appear.

## Using snippets in Markdown

With the [dst-parser](https://github.com/soramitsu/dst-parser) and
downloader doing their parts of the task, it is possible to import the
snippets.

Keeping in mind that a default snippet directory is `src/snippets/`, a
snippet could be imported as follows:

**Input**

```md
<<<@/snippets/debug_rust_Lorem.rs
```

**Output**

<<<@/snippets/debug_rust_Lorem.rs

Follow
[VitePress documentation](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown#import-code-snippets)
for further details about snippets syntax.

## Organizing snippets into code groups

**Input**

```md
:::code-group

<<<@/snippets/debug_java_Lorem.java

### Title for Python

<<<@/snippets/debug_python_Lorem.py

<<<@/snippets/debug_javascript_Lorem.js

<<<@/snippets/debug_typescript_Lorem.ts

<<<@/snippets/debug_rust_Lorem.rs

<<<@/snippets/debug_shell_Lorem.sh

:::
```

**Output**

:::code-group

<<<@/snippets/debug_java_Lorem.java

### Title for Python

<<<@/snippets/debug_python_Lorem.py

<<<@/snippets/debug_javascript_Lorem.js

<<<@/snippets/debug_typescript_Lorem.ts

<<<@/snippets/debug_rust_Lorem.rs

<<<@/snippets/debug_shell_Lorem.sh
